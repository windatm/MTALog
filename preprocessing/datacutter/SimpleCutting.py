    Returns:
        tuple:
            - list: Shuffled instances (used as training data).

def cut_by(train, dev, anomalous_rate=1):

    Returns a customized data splitting function that partitions a dataset into
    training, development, and test sets based on given proportions.

    Additionally, it can **downsample anomalous instances** in the training set 
    by keeping only a fraction (controlled by `anomalous_rate` âˆˆ [0, 1]).

    Args:
        train (float): Proportion of data to be used for training (0 < train < 1).
        dev (float): Proportion of data to be used for development (0 < dev < 1).
        anomalous_rate (float): Probability of keeping an anomalous instance in the training set.

    Returns:
        function: A function `cut(instances)` that applies the defined split and filtering.

    Example:
        splitter = cut_by(0.7, 0.1, anomalous_rate=0.2)
        train, dev, test = splitter(instances)
